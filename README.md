# GlobalSettings
Minecraft mod that synchronizes settings between instances

## Usage
Install on any modpack and enable it via commands. Your settings will be synced or a new profile created for you if none exists.

Note: All keybinds that have not been set previously will be rebound to `NONE`. New packs that have different commands will require you to set all keys that are not saved.

## Commands
* `/globalsettings help` - Displays help options
* `/globalsettings enable` - Enables setting sync
* `/globalsettings disable` - Disables setting sync
* `/gs` - alias for `/globalsettings`
